Q1. What’s const-correctness and why is it important?
A1. Const-correctness is basically making sure that parts of the code that
 shouldn’t change, actually can’t change. In specific on c++ if something is const, it 
 means we can’t accidentally modify it. This helps us to prevent bugs and makes 
 our code safer and easier to understand.

Q2. Is your class const-correct? How do you know?
A2. Yes, my class is const-correct. I know it is because the methods that 
only read data (getValue()) are marked as const, which ensures they can’t
 modify the object. Also, I don’t try to modify const variables, so everything 
 is in order always.
